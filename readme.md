# Rust Drag Race

I decided to create a drag race simulator fully within the terminal with Rust. It was meant to learn how to use Rust Structs more and I think I succeeded at that.

## Features

- Choose car count
- Restart or exit option when race finishes

## Todo

- Add Tie Detection
- Unit Tests
